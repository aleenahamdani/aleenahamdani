### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aleena Hamdani. I am an aspiring Bio Scientist currenty pursuing my Masters in Bio Informatics. 


Embarking on a master's journey in bioinformatics after earning a bachelor's degree in applied biosciences has been a fascinating transition and considering my non-computer science background, navigating this realm is both challenging and rewarding for me. 

My academic focus lies at the intriguing crossroads of computational biomedical engineering and machine learning with a slight touch of involving nanobiotechnology.  

Currently, I'm on a quest to fortify my Python programming skills, a task essential for navigating the dynamic landscape of bioinformatics.

Alongside my academic pursuits, I find solace and joy in playing badminton, a favorite hobby that not only keeps me physically active but also serves as a delightful way to unwind. Beyond that, I cherish spending quality time with friends and family, relishing moments of connection and occasionally indulging in Netflix to find respite and inspiration in the diverse stories that unfold on the screen.
